Sorting Mini Project
* Me, Yuri, and Edwin worked on this project. We used a dataset 100,000 cities, and sorted them using several different sorting methods to sort the cities according to the length of their names. I worked on the frontend and backend, specifically on the tables for the fibonacci sequence and the sorting, and the backend code for the fibonacci sequence. I also helped Yuri with some CORS issues he had with the sorting code.
