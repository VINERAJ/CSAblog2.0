## Projects
Multiplayer Typing Game
* This was our NATM project last tri. I worked on the backend, helping to link it to the frontend. 
* Links
    * Backend commits: [first backend](https://github.com/BobTheFarmer/VACTQ-Backend/graphs/contributors?from=2023-09-24&to=2024-01-17&type=c), [last backend](https://github.com/BobTheFarmer/VACTQ-Backend4/graphs/contributors?from=2023-09-24&to=2024-01-17&type=c)
        * We had to change backends
    * Frontend: [VACTQ Racers](https://bobthefarmer.github.io/VACTQ-Typing-Game/)

Sorting Mini Project
* Me, Yuri, and Edwin worked on this project. We used a dataset 100,000 cities, and sorted them using several different sorting methods to sort the cities according to the length of their names. I worked on the frontend and backend, specifically on the tables for the fibonacci sequence and the sorting, and the backend code for the fibonacci sequence. I also helped Yuri with some CORS issues he had with the sorting code.

## College Board prep/tests
* 2014 score: ![CB Score for 2014](https://github.com/VINERAJ/CSAblog2.0/blob/main/images/2014_score.png?raw=true)
* 2015 score: ![CB Score for 2015](https://github.com/VINERAJ/CSAblog2.0/blob/main/images/score_2015.png?raw=true)
* I improved on my score from the 2014 exam to the 2015 exam. One thing that I am concerned about is the amount of time that I am taking on these exams. I try to go over each of the questions carefully, but this meant that I took too long on them. If this were the actual AP exam, then I would run out of time, and fail to complete the exam. My goal is to reduce the time that I take on practice CB exams. I plan to review the student teaching from tri 1, especially the topics that I missed on the previous two exams. If this is not enough, I will do additional research.

## Timebox
* [Timebox](https://vineraj.github.io/CSAblog2.0/AD_compsci.html)
* I try to put everything I do in this class into my timebox. This include student lessons and hacks, projects, and plans. I use the plans to stay organized, and I use the student lessons as a reference for future study.

## Upcoming project
I'm really excited to make a game that can both be useful as an educational tool, and be fun to play. I want to make something that people are genuinely interested in playing, and aren't just bored by the educational elements. For this project, I'm going to resolve to learn more backend elements, especially JWT. I think the best way to do that is to make a login system for our project.
