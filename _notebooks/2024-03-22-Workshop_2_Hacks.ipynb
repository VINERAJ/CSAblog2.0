    "## Question 1 - Pojos and Access Control:\n",
    "Situation: The school librarian wants to create a program that stores all of the books within the library in a database and is used to manage their inventory of books available to the students. You decided to put your amazing code skills to work and help out the librarian!\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Describe the key differences between the private and public access controllers and how it affects a POJO\n",
    "Private access controllers means that the variables can only be accessed within the class they are declared in, which mean that a POJO needs to have dedicated methods to access and modify it. Public access controllers means that the variables can be accessed everywhere, throughout the whole program.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Identify a scenario when you would use the private vs. public access controllers that isn't the one given in the scenario above\n",
    "If you don't want your users to be able to access certain data, like maybe passwords or something, you can make the variable private to prevent it being accessed without specific methods in their classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Create a Book class that represents the following attributes about a book: title, author, date published, person holding the book and make sure that the objects are using a POJO, the proper getters and setters and are secure from any other modifications that the program makes later to the objects\n"

    "(a) Explain how a constructor works, including when it runs and what generally is done within a constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "A constructor a a special method that runs when a class is created. It usually initializes instance variables in the object. They can take no arguments (in which case they will initialize instance variables to a default value), or 1+ arguments, initializing instance variables to those arguments as described in the constructor.\n",

Then, run the constructor at least twice with different variables and demonstrate that these two objects called different constructors. "
