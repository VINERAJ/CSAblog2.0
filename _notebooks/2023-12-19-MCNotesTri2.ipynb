Therefore, when you make this double and int, you only get integer values from 0-5, which is not how a six-sided die works. Therefore, you'd need to add two (int)Math.random()*6 together, and then add 2 two it to get a full range of values from 2-12. This would accurately simulate rolling 2 six-sided dices.\n",

    " The process of taking this MCQ was informative. I took me longer than I expected. I tried to make sure that I was thorough in selecting my answers, so I would maximize my score. Some questions really tricked me, like question 3, so they took longer. Others were easier, and I was easily able to answer them correctly. The test gave me a good gauge on where I am in terms of being ready for the AP exam in the spring. I think that I'm better than I was last tri, but I still need to do some work before I'm ready for the exam. "

    "By doing this MC, I learnt a lot. Most noticeably, I think I learned more about the specifics of several methods within Java. For example, I barely knew what the .set() method did before I took the MC. But now, I fully know what it does. More importantly, taking the MC taught me how to look at and analyze Java code. From now, I'll be better able to look at my Java code when it is giving me problems and debug it. This will help me in future projects, in CSA and beyond, whenever I run into bugs in my code."

    "After having taken the MC, there are several topics that I have identified as ones that I need to work on. For example, one is inheritance. Although I thought I knew it pretty well, I think I will need to review it once again. I also need to review other things like arrays and loops, which were the topics of some questions that I missed. Most importantly, I think that I need to learning boolean algebra and operators. I feel like this was the topic that I knew the least about. I think this is because I had little knowledge of it before CSA, whereas I at least knew some Java before the start of the school year. To learn more about these topics, I think that I might incorporate them in a future project, to further learn how they work. For boolean algebra, I might need to do some separate studying."
