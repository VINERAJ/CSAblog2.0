    "* We managed to do well on the actual day of the performance \n",
    "* We managed to score a 45/50\n",
    "* Our score breakdown was:\n",
    "    * 10, 9, 9, 9\n",
    "* Things we could have improved on:\n",
    "    * We could have made our \"costumes\" more clear, so that our audience could see our numbers clearly\n",
    "    * Could have made script more clear so that audience was clearer on what was going on.\n",
    "    * Could have practiced the script more\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenges\n",
    "* It was hard to organize practices, since we were split between two different CSA classes, not to mention the CSP members of our team, and the former CS students\n",
    "* In addition, some people prioritized their jobs and other classes over practicing for the dance-unavoidable\n",

    "## Notable People\n",
    "* Tirth was very important in helping with the script and organizing practices\n",
    "* Haseeb was also helpful in organizing practices and working on the script, and also working on the music\n",
    "* Vinay helped with the script and helped with creating the designs\n",
