    "This FRQ primarily involves interfaces, but it also involves methods and control structures. The NumberGroup class has a contains method, which is extended to the range and the multiple groups classes. In terms of control structures, it also uses for and if else loops. These are used to check whether the integers are in the number groups, through using for loops to iterate through the NumberGroups. In the MultipleGroups class, the contains method is overwritten so that it has a different implementation than the contains method in the NumberGroups class. The MultipleGroups class also uses for loops to check whether the integers are in any of the NumberGroups."
