    "## Question 3-ArrayList(Unit 6)\n",
    "Situation: You are developing a student management system where you need to store and analyze the grades of students in a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Define an arrayList in Java. Explain its significance and usefulness in programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "An arrayList is a Java object that are similar to arrays, in terms of their ability to store data, but while arrays have a fixed size determined at their creation, you can change the size of an arrayList when necessary. This is very useful in cases where you do not know the size of the data you want to store before creating the array/arrayList, for example, if you want to create a list of all the people in CSA who have completed their hacks on time. You don't know how many people will do this, so using an arrayList would be appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to implement a method `calculateAverageGrade` that takes an arrayList `grades` of integers representing student grades and returns the average of all the elements in the arrayList. Write the method signature and the method implementation. Include comments to explain your code.\n"
